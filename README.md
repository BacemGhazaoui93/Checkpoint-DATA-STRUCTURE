Problem 1

Setting the sum variable as 0.

1. Reading the two sets of integers
2- Comparing all the numbers in both sets, finding the distinct ones and adding them to the sum
   * An outer for loop that goes from the start of the first array to the end of it . This will run to compare each element with the other array
   *A first inner for loop that goes from the stat of the second array to the end of it . this We will compare one by one each element of the second array (j) with the index  element of the first array (i).
   * An inner while loop that will each time that finds difference betwenn the two element will add the number to the sum variable.
3- Once we went through all the elements , the loops closes and we will print the value of sum

Problem 2

1.creating a preocedure/function that calculates the product (in a variable ps) of a pair of vectors v1 & v2
2.ALGORITHM Dot product
*Asking the user to specify the number of pairs so we can determine the number of elements in the array (the given number * 2)
3. we will go through the table reading the numbers one by one : every two numbers are considered as a pair of vector 
4-Solutuion to our probelm : calculate the product of each provided pair
 Usig a for loop we will calculate the dot.product of each two provided vector using the created procedure/Function :
    IF the product equals 0 we will show to the user that "the two vectors are orthogonal"
    If not we will show to the user that "the two vectors are not orthogonal"
